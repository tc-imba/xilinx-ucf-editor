# xilinx-ucf-editor

xilinx-ucf-editor is a very simple tool to create and edit ucf (User Constraint File) files used by Xilinx.

Use it [online](https://tc-imba.github.io/xilinx-ucf-editor/xilinx-ucf-editor.html) here.

It is written in vanilla-js, and pure html, so any modern browser (IE, Edge, Chrome, Firefox and so on) can use it.

If a `.sch` file is inputted, A table of ports with their types and names will be generated.

If a `.ucf` file is inputted, it can be edited in the table. (not jet completed)
